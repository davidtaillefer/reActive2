# 🏃‍♂️ reActive

A full-stack fitness activity parser and visualization app that ingests **FIT, TCX (and future GPX)** files and transforms them into a **unified, normalized data model** for analysis and visualization.

## 🚀 Features

## 🎥 Screenshots & Demo

### 🗺️ Route Map with Metric Coloring

Visualize activities with dynamic coloring based on grade, heart rate, speed, or power.

---

### ❤️ Heart Rate Zones

Time-in-zone visualization with automatically computed or device-provided zones.

---

### ⚡ Power Zones

Coggan-based power zones with fallback computation from activity records.

---

### 📊 Interactive Hover Sync

Hover over charts or map to highlight corresponding points across all views.

---

### 🧭 Multi-Activity Support

Overlay multiple activities and compare metrics visually.

### 📥 Multi-Format Parsing

* ✅ FIT (Garmin / device-native)
* ✅ TCX (Training Center XML)
* 🔜 GPX support (planned)

---

### 🔄 Unified Data Pipeline

All input formats are normalized into a single schema:

```json
{
  "sessions": [],
  "laps": [],
  "records": [],
  "zones": {
    "heart_rate": {},
    "power": {}
  }
}
```

This ensures:

* Consistent frontend behavior
* Format-agnostic analytics
* Easier extensibility

---

### 🧠 Smart Zone Computation

Supports:

* ✅ Device-provided zones (FIT)
* ✅ Precomputed zones (TCX)
* ✅ Fallback computation from records

#### Heart Rate Zones

* Based on % of max HR
* Automatically inferred if not present

#### Power Zones

* Based on % of FTP (Coggan model)
* Fully computed when missing

---

### 🗺️ Interactive Map (Vue + Leaflet)

* Route visualization with:

  * Gradient coloring by:

    * Grade
    * Heart rate
    * Speed
    * Power
* Hover sync across components
* Downsampling for performance
* Multi-activity support

---

### 📊 Data Visualizations

* Time in zone charts (HR + Power)
* Metric cards (HR, speed, etc.)
* Clean reusable components

## 🔧 Backend Architecture

### Data Flow

```
FIT / TCX File
      ↓
Parser (format-specific)
      ↓
Normalized Models (Record, Lap, Session)
      ↓
Zone Computation (HR + Power)
      ↓
Unified JSON API
```

---

### Core Models

* `Record` → individual trackpoint
* `Lap` → grouped records
* `Session` → full activity
* `Zones` → HR / Power distributions

---

### Key Concepts

#### ✔ Typed Data Models

* Replaces raw dict iteration
* Centralizes validation
* Improves maintainability

#### ✔ Validation Layer

* Field-level validation
* Handles NaN, missing values, type coercion

#### ✔ Graceful Fallbacks

* Missing data is computed where possible
* Prevents frontend breakage

---

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture

### Vue 3 + Composition API

* Reactive data handling
* Modular components
* Clean separation of concerns

---

### RouteMap Component

Handles:

* Track normalization
* Multi-lap merging
* Metric-based coloring
* Hover interaction

---

### Zone Components

* Unified schema supports:

  * HR zones
  * Power zones
* Easily extendable to other metrics

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

* Track downsampling for map rendering
* Lazy map initialization
* Deferred polyline rendering
* Minimal reactivity overhead

---

## 🧪 Example API Response

```json
{
  "sessions": [...],
  "laps": [...],
  "records": [...],
  "zones": {
    "heart_rate": {
      "type": "heart_rate",
      "source": "computed",
      "zones": [...]
    },
    "power": {
      "type": "power",
      "source": "computed",
      "zones": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Challenges

* FIT files vary widely by device/vendor
* TCX lacks many advanced metrics
* Timezone normalization can be tricky
* Large files require careful performance handling

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* GPX parser
* Cadence & advanced metrics
* Training load / TSS
* Segment detection
* Caching layer for large files
* Web worker offloading for parsing

---

## 💡 Philosophy

> Normalize everything early, and the rest of the system becomes simple.

This project is built around the idea that **data consistency beats format-specific complexity**.
